<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Simeon</h1>
<h3 align="center">Iâ€™m an Senior Automation QA Engineer with a strong focus on building reliable, scalable test automation using tools like Playwright, Cypress, Puppeteer, and Jest. I work across frontend and backend layers, ensuring stability and performance through clean, efficient test code.

Outside of work, I build side projects that let me dive deeper into web technologiesâ€”whether itâ€™s experimenting with new frameworks, crafting APIs, or putting together full-stack apps. Iâ€™m driven by curiosity and a constant desire to improve both the user experience and the development process.
